[00:24.50]Nobody ever knows
[00:27.20]Nobody ever sees
[00:30.03]I left my soul
[00:32.72]Back then, no I'm too weak
[00:35.51]Most nights I pray for you to come home
[00:41.46]Praying to the lord
[00:44.50]Praying for my soul
[00:46.44]Now please don't go
[00:52.52]Most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone
[00:57.71]Now please don't go, oh no
[01:03.65]I think of you whenever I'm alone
[01:07.98]So please don't go
[01:20.92]'Cause I don't ever wanna know
[01:24.38]Don't ever want to see things change

[01:29.81]I wanna take it back and start again
[01:32.64]Most nights I pray for you to come home
